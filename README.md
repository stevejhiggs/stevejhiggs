## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack developer with roughly 25 years of experience. Starting with c++ I've wended a road through asp, c# and java. I now mostly spend my time in js though using nodejs for backend and various frontend frameworks (and bun when I can get away with it).

Currently I work as chief architect at Veed.io, doing fun things with video at scale.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on

- [big ui](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/big-ui) - an experiment in how to handle development and deployment of large scale frontend projects
- [fastify skeleton](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/fastify-typescript-skeleton) an attempt at a "batteries included" production ready fastify api.

### ðŸ¤” Previously

There's a number of repos in here that were useful at the time but are now effectively abandoned. Either due to lack of time or (more often) that the problem they were solving now has a better solution.

- [gulp-webpack-es6-pipeline](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/gulp-webpack-es6-pipeline) - simple gulp task to convert es6 to browser es5 (no longer needed)
- [gulp-webpack-typescript-pipeline](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/gulp-webpack-typescript-pipeline) - simple gulp task to convert typescript to browser es5 (no longer needed)
- [aws-lambda-typescript](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/aws-lambda-typescript) - bundle and deploy a typescript based lamda to aws.

Some repos also support some old talks I've done, but again they should no longer be treated as up-to-date:

- [less terrible javascript](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/lessTerribleJavascript)

- [converting a node service to typescript](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/convertNodeServiceToTypescript) - converting a js based express service to typescript step by step.
